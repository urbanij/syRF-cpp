# syRF-cpp


CAD tool for designing RF and microwave circuits. <br>

Fork of [syRF](https://github.com/urbanij/syRF), re-written from scratch in C++.

#### Build:
See [BUILD.md](https://github.com/urbanij/syRF-cpp/blob/master/BUILD.md).

---
##### Note:
Although this compiles natively and is able to generate a stand-alone application, it does not implement all the functionalities that [the original Python version](https://github.com/urbanij/syRF) of syRF does, such as plotting constant gain/noise circles.
