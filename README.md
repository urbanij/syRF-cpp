---
This is a fork of the original Python version of [syRF](https://github.com/urbanij/syRF), re-written from scratch in C++.


#### Build instructions:
See [BUILD.md](https://github.com/urbanij/syRF-cpp/blob/master/BUILD.md).

---
##### Note:
Although this compiles natively and is able to generate a stand-alone application, it does not implement all the functionalities that [the original Python version](https://github.com/urbanij/syRF) of syRF does, such as plotting constant gain/noise circles.
